Technologies used include:
* React to generate (most of) the views
* Ruby on Rails on the backend
* The <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails">React-Rails gem</a> to integrate the two
* PostgreSQL for the data
* Devise for account authorization
* Customized Bootstrap for the CSS
* Dropbox to host the icons, which I got from The Noun Project
* jQuery UI Sortable plugin for the drag-and-drop functionality

To-do list:
* Actually save order changes in sequences
* Search-box plugin for asanas on the sequence page
* Ability to favorite/star another user's sequences
* Generally React-ify the project

While building the data for this project, I also created <a href="http://github.com/rebeccaestes/yoga_api">what may be the only public yoga API in existence</a>.
