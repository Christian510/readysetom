Technologies used include:
* React to generate (most of) the views
* Ruby on Rails on the backend
* <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails">React-Rails gem</a> to integrate the two
* PostgreSQL for the data
* Devise for account authorization
* Customized Bootstrap for the CSS
* Dropbox to host the icons, which I got from The Noun Project
* jQuery UI Sortable plugin for the drag-and-drop functionality

To-do list for future iterations:
* Be able to actually save order changes in sequences!
* Cut the drop-down menus, and instead add asanas to your sequence by clicking on them
* Implement a search-box plugin for asanas on the sequence page
* Allow users the option to share their sequences and custom asanas publically
* Let users copy other users' custom asanas to their own account, and favorite other users' sequences
* Generally React-ify the project

While building the data for this project, I also created <a href="http://github.com/rebeccaestes/yoga_api">what may be the only public yoga API in existence</a>.
